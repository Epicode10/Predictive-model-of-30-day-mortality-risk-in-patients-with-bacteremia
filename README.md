# Predictive model of 30-day mortality risk in patients with bacteremia
The model was conducted by random forest to predict 30-day mortality risk in patients with community-onset bacteremia. The performance of this model showed ROC AUC: 0.896; Brier score: 9.0; Accuracy: 0.883; Recall: 0.989; Precision: 0.886; F1 score: 0.934.
The manuscript has been submitted: "An interpretable machine learning approach to evaluate 30-day mortality risk in patients with community-onset bacteremia".
